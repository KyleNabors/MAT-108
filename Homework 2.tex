\item Express the following proposition using only the symbols we have
defined in class (you cannot use English words or define extra symbols):
\textit{For any nonzero real number $x$, there is exactly one real number
$y$ such that $xy=1$.}

\subitem $(\forall x \in \mathbb R_{\ne 0})(\exists!y \in\bR)(xy=1)$


\item Suppose while reading a proof that you come across the following
argument: \textit{We have shown that if a square matrix is not invertible
then it has determinant $0$, and we have shown that a square matrix with
two identical rows has determinant $0$. Therefore a square matrix with two
identical rows is not invertible.} Is this reasoning correct? Justify your
answer by labeling the assertions in this statement $P$, $Q$, and $R$ and
making an appropriate truth table.

\subitem Let P be the statement a square matrix is  not invertible

\subitem Let Q be the statement a square matrix has a determinant $0$

\subitem Let R be the statement a square matrix has two identical rows

\subitem We can rewrite the given argument as:
\subitem $[(P \Rightarrow Q) \land (R \Rightarrow Q)] \Rightarrow (R \Rightarrow P)$
\subitem We can check this argument with a truth table 
\subitem Given the tables output we can see that while the argument may be true in some cases, since it is not exclusively true it is a false statement.

\item Use a direct proof to show that if $a,b\in\bZ$ are both positive
and $a\,|\,b$ and $b\,|\,a$, then $a=b$.

Proposition: If $a,b\in\bZ$ are both positive and $a\,|\,b$ and $b\,|\,a$, then $a=b$.

Proof: Let $a,b\in\bZ$ 
By definition there exists some $x,y\in\bZ$ that are both positive such that $a\,|\,b = x$ and $b\,|\,a = y$
We can rearrange these statements as $a = bx$ and $b = ay$
Substituting in our first equation into our second we find that $b = xyb$ which we can rewrite as $1 = xy$ Given x and y are both positive intigers we they both must be equal to one. 
This implies $a\,|\,b = 1$ and $b\,|\,a = 1$
Both of these equations can be written as $a = b$

\item We say an integer $n$ is even if and only if $2\,|\,n$, and odd
otherwise. Use a proof by contraposition to show that if there exists a
positive integer $k$ such that $n^k$ is odd, then $n$ is odd.

Proposition: There exists a positive integer $k$ such that $n^k$ is odd, then $n$ is odd

Proof: Assume n is even. Therefore $n^k$ is even for all positive intigers k.
If n is even there exists some m such that 2m = n
We can then rewrite $n^k$ as $(2m)^k$ or $2^k * m^k$
Given $2^k$ is even and is a factor of $m^k$ it must be true that for  all  k $m^k$ is even. 
Given $2^k$ and $m^k$ are even this implies $(2m)^k$ is even witch implies for all k $n^k$ is even

\item Suppose you have just proved that if $n\in\bZ$ is odd then $n+1$
is even. Use this fact in a proof by cases to show that $n^2-3n+8$ is even
for all $n\in\bZ$.

Proof: Let $n\in\bZ$ be odd and $n+1$ be even
There exists some m such that $n^2-3n+8$ 
We can rewrite m as $m = (n^2-3n-4)+12$ 




\vspace{100pt}





To prove that $n^2 - 3n + 8$ is even for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ using a proof by cases, we consider the two possible cases for $n$: either $n$ is odd or $n$ is even.

Case 1: $n$ is odd.

By the given fact, if $n$ is odd, then $n + 1$ is even. Let $n = 2k_1 + 1$ for some integer $k_1$. Then, $n + 1 = 2k_1 + 2 = 2(k_1 + 1)$, which is even. Now, let's consider the expression $n^2 - 3n + 8$:

$n^2 - 3n + 8 = (2k_1 + 1)^2 - 3(2k_1 + 1) + 8$

$= (4k_1^2 + 4k_1 + 1) - (6k_1 + 3) + 8$

$= 4k_1^2 + 4k_1 + 1 - 6k_1 - 3 + 8$

$= 4k_1^2 - 2k_1 + 6$

$= 2(2k_1^2 - k_1 + 3)$

Since $2k_1^2 - k_1 + 3$ is an integer, the expression $n^2 - 3n + 8$ is even in this case.

Case 2: $n$ is even.

Let $n = 2k_2$ for some integer $k_2$. Now, let's consider the expression $n^2 - 3n + 8$:

$n^2 - 3n + 8 = (2k_2)^2 - 3(2k_2) + 8$

$= 4k_2^2 - 6k_2 + 8$

$= 2(2k_2^2 - 3k_2 + 4)$

Since $2k_2^2 - 3k_2 + 4$ is an integer, the expression $n^2 - 3n + 8$ is even in this case.

We have shown that $n^2 - 3n + 8$ is even in both cases when $n$ is odd and when $n$ is even. Therefore, $n^2 - 3n + 8$ is even for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}$.
